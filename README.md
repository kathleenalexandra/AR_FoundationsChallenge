# AR_FoundationsChallenge

In the following repo, I have included the three core scripts used to accomplish functionality, alongside a short demo video. In this,  I have provided both a UI manager and Task Manager, as this is typically how I would set up a similar project. Please note that the frame rate on the video is a result of the screen capture software, and not lag in the application. The video was shot on an iPhone6 using a development build.  

In the creation of the demo, I . looked to the example code in https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples for how to utalize and work with the generated planes in ARFoundatoin. I have documented in my comments the functions I adapted in my own code from this example.
