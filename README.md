# AR_FoundationsChallenge

I have included the three core scripts used to accomplish functionality. I have provided both a UI manager and Task Manager, as this is typically how I would set up a similar project. 

As mentioned, I looked to the example code in https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples for how to utalize and work with the generated planes. I have documented in my comments the functions I adapted in my own code from this example.
